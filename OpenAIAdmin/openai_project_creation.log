2025-08-11 00:17:24,024 - INFO -     Description: I’m working on a project where users can pick their data using a custom query language that’s kind of like RQL. My goal is to make this way easier—so instead of figuring out the exact syntax, people can just type what they want in plain English.

Here’s my plan: I’ll use OpenAI’s language models to read plain English requests (like “Get all users who signed up last month”) and turn them into RQL format. Since we’ve got solid docs, object structure info, and some test cases, I’ll set things up so the AI knows the custom rules—feeding in those examples, sample queries, and object details so it can do a good job matching what users want with the right query.

Because all of this is in a notebook or Databricks, it should be fast to test, tweak, and fix if the AI gets it wrong.
