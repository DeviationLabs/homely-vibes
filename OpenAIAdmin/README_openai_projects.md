# OpenAI Project Creation Script

This script automates the creation of OpenAI projects from a spreadsheet containing team names and email addresses.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  # nosecret
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python create_openai_projects.py sample_teams.csv
```

### With API key as argument
```bash
python create_openai_projects.py sample_teams.csv --api-key "your-api-key"  # nosecret
```

### Dry run (preview without creating)
```bash
python create_openai_projects.py sample_teams.csv --dry-run
```

### Custom budget settings
```bash
# Set $150 budget limit with alert at 60% ($90)
python create_openai_projects.py sample_teams.csv --budget-limit 150 --alert-threshold 0.6

# Set $300 budget with default 50% alert threshold
python create_openai_projects.py sample_teams.csv --budget-limit 300
```

## Spreadsheet Format

The script supports multiple spreadsheet formats and automatically detects the column structure:

### HackWeek Format (Preferred)
The script automatically detects HackWeek CSV format with these key columns:
- **Project Name**: `"Give us a project name in slug format (e.g: lms-support-bot, hris-data-inspector)"`  
- **Email**: `"Email Address"`

### Legacy Format (Backwards Compatible)
For simple CSV files, the script supports these column name variations:
- **Team Name**: `team_name`, `team`, `name`, `project_name`
- **Email**: `email`, `mail`, `user_email`

### Supported Formats
- CSV files (`.csv`)
- Excel files (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)

### Example HackWeek CSV:
