# Rachio-Flume Water Tracking Integration

A Python integration that connects Rachio irrigation controllers with Flume water monitoring devices to track zone-specific water usage and generate comprehensive reports.

## Features

- **Rachio Integration**: Monitor active zones and watering events
- **Flume Integration**: Track real-time water consumption across all devices
- **Data Correlation**: Match watering events with water usage patterns
- **Weekly Reports**: Generate detailed reports with:
  - Average watering rate by zone
  - Total duration each zone was watered
  - Water efficiency analysis
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated data collection service
- **SQLite Storage**: Persistent data storage with session tracking

## Setup

### Credentials Configuration

Add your API credentials to `lib/Constants.py`:

```python
# Rachio API credentials  
RACHIO_API_KEY = "abc123..."
RACHIO_ID = "device-uuid..."

# Flume API credentials (get from https://portal.flumetech.com/#token)
FLUME_CLIENT_ID = "client-id..."  
FLUME_CLIENT_SECRET = "client-secret..."
FLUME_USER_EMAIL = "your-email@example.com"
FLUME_PASSWORD = "your-password..."
```

**Note**: The credentials are sourced from `lib/Constants.py` instead of environment variables for consistency with the broader project architecture.

### Installation

From the project root directory:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

All commands should be run from the RachioFlume directory.

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Start continuous data collection** (run in background)
2. **Check status** anytime to see active zones and flow rates  
3. **Generate reports** after collecting data for several days/weeks

### ðŸ”„ Data Collection (Continuous Operation)

For best results, run the collector continuously to gather data over time:

```bash
# Start continuous collection in background (recommended)
nohup uv run python rfmanager.py collect --continuous > water_tracking.log 2>&1 &

# Or run in foreground (will stop when terminal closes)
uv run python rfmanager.py collect --continuous

# Run single collection cycle (for testing)
uv run python rfmanager.py collect --once

# Custom collection intervals
uv run python rfmanager.py collect --continuous --interval 120    # Every 2 minutes
uv run python rfmanager.py collect --continuous --interval 600    # Every 10 minutes (default: 300)
```

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Let the collector run for at least a week to get meaningful reports and efficiency analysis!

### ðŸ“Š System Status (Check Anytime)

```bash
# See current active zone and real-time usage rate
uv run python rfmanager.py status
```

Example output:
```
==================================================
WATER TRACKING SYSTEM STATUS
==================================================
Active Zone: #11 - Z11 BB - Outer Perim
Current Usage Rate: 6.14 GPM
Recent Sessions (24h): 15
Last Rachio Collection: 2023-07-15T10:30:00
Last Flume Collection: 2023-07-15T10:35:00
==================================================
```

### ðŸ“ˆ Reports (After Data Collection)

Generate comprehensive reports once you have collected data:

```bash
# Current week report
uv run python rfmanager.py report --current-week

# Last week report  
uv run python rfmanager.py report --last-week

# Zone efficiency analysis (requires multiple watering sessions)
uv run python rfmanager.py report --efficiency

# Save reports to JSON files
uv run python rfmanager.py report --current-week --save
uv run python rfmanager.py report --last-week --save
```

### ðŸ›‘ Stop Data Collection

```bash
# Find the background process
ps aux | grep "rfmanager.py collect"

# Stop it
kill <process_id>

# Or if running in foreground, just use Ctrl+C
```

## Architecture

### Components

1. **RachioClient** (`rachio_client.py`)
   - Interfaces with Rachio API
   - Retrieves zone information and watering events
   - Monitors active watering sessions

2. **FlumeClient** (`flume_client.py`)
   - Interfaces with Flume API using OAuth2 JWT authentication
   - Automatically discovers and queries all user devices
   - Aggregates water usage readings across multiple devices
   - Provides current flow rate data

3. **WaterTrackingDB** (`data_storage.py`)
   - SQLite database for persistent storage
   - Stores zones, events, readings, and computed sessions
   - Handles data relationships and indexing

4. **WaterTrackingCollector** (`collector.py`)
   - Orchestrates data collection from both APIs
   - Runs continuously or on-demand
   - Correlates watering events with usage data

5. **WeeklyReporter** (`reporter.py`)
   - Generates comprehensive reports
   - Calculates zone efficiency metrics
   - Exports data in multiple formats

### Database Schema

- **zones**: Zone configuration and metadata
- **watering_events**: Raw events from Rachio API
- **water_readings**: Time-series usage data from Flume
- **zone_sessions**: Computed watering sessions with usage correlation

## API Rate Limits

- **Rachio**: 1,700 calls/day rate limit
- **Flume**: Check your plan's API limits

The collector is designed to respect these limits with configurable polling intervals.
